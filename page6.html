            Hmmm interesting choice.... Upon kissing the mysterious stranger you realize your whole life has been a lie. You dont want to be a knight anymore instead you want to live the rest of your days being in love with this stranger and his horse. You drop all your duties to live a happy life. ☀️ ☀️ ☀️

       <br>   PS. Princess Zolia gave up on waiting for a man to save her. She took the job of saving herself as a way to regain her independece from her father. She also spends three years looking for you and when she finds you... *whisper* she kills you and your whole family lol. 💀 ( i mean you did leave her in a dungeon to rot sir )
