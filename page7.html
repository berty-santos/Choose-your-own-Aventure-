            OH NO !!! it seems you tried the wrong guy. It turns out the owner of the carriage is a legendary Archer. As you tried to run away he launched a magical arrow that upon touch it exposed the truth of all life. You realize nothing is worth fighting for since you live on a floating rock. You drop all your duties and go home. 

        <br>  PS. Princess Zolia dies waiting for you 💀 its chill though you picked some berries on the way home. 🏰☀️
